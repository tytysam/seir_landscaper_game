//  Landscaper PSEUDOCODE
//  ============================

// --> TOOLs: 1.) Teeth 2.) Rusty Scissors 3.) Old-Timey Push Mower
// --> TOOLs: 4.) Fancy Battery-Powered Lawnmower 5.) Team of Starving Students

// Because of how many tools we have, I'm thinking I want to use a class constructor
// to quickly build the tool objects with shared properties..
//
// days will pass
// we will accumulate money in some way...
// and we can spend that money on tools...
//
//
//
// USER INPUTS --> Reset, Cut the Grass, OR Buy/Upgrade a new Tool (if you have enough money)
//
// Winning message: Congratulations, you've won! It took you ${days} to accumulate $1,000.
// Since day one, you've clipped ${#ofLawns} and grossed total earnings of ${totalDollarsMade}.
// Think you can create a landscaping empire in even better time? Play again --> Button.
//
//
//
// Day 0: Introduce the game, explain the rules, explain the goal, etc.
// Day 1: You spent all day mowing lawns with your teeth. Maybe not the most effective, but it earned you a dollar!
//
//
//
// DELIVERABLES:
// 1.) The ability to take user input
// 2.) The ability for the user to earn money
// 3.) The ability to buy tools and use the new tool
// 4.) The ability to win the game and end it
// 5.) The ability to reset the game at any point so that you can play again.
// 6.) Make it so that the user can have multiple tools
// 7.) ONce you've implemented multiple tools, make it so you can sell tools for half their price.
// 8.) Make the game playable via the DOM via BUTTONS (see --> Lapis, Papyrus, Scalpellus)
// 9.)
